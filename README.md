Project Overview
This Weather Forecasting System is designed to predict future weather conditions using advanced techniques in machine learning. The system leverages Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to model the complex, non-linear relationships between various weather variables, improving accuracy over traditional linear models.

The project was developed with the aim to provide precise weather predictions for applications in agriculture, aviation, electricity management, tourism, and daily life. By focusing on non-linear data analysis, this system enhances the accuracy of forecasts and provides critical insights for strategic planning.

Features
Non-linear Weather Prediction: Utilizes Artificial Neural Networks to capture the non-linear relationships between weather variables.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared historical weather data for training the model.
Multi-variable Input: The system can handle multiple weather parameters, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure, to predict future conditions.
Real-time Application: The trained model can be integrated into real-time weather systems for continuous forecasting.
Scalable Design: Built with scalability in mind, making it adaptable for use with different datasets and in various geographic regions.
Motivation
Accurate weather prediction has a wide range of critical applications, including agriculture planning, aviation safety, disaster preparedness, and more. Traditional linear methods often fail to capture the complex, irregular patterns present in weather data. This project addresses that gap by applying Artificial Neural Networks, which are well-suited for modeling non-linear phenomena.

Technology Stack
Language: Python
Machine Learning: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), utilizing libraries like TensorFlow/Keras and Scikit-learn.
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Database: CSV file-based dataset for historical weather data
How It Works
Data Collection: Historical weather data is collected, cleaned, and preprocessed to ensure quality inputs for the machine learning model.
Model Training: An Artificial Neural Network is trained on the historical data. The network learns patterns from the data and fine-tunes its weights and biases to minimize prediction error.
Model Testing: The trained model is tested on unseen data to evaluate its accuracy and generalization capabilities.
Prediction: The system can then predict future weather conditions based on the input variables.
